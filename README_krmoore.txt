My current task for the Trap_Sat project is to develop a system for 
communications between the cube satellites. Currently, we are going to be
testing if an XBee bluetooth/wireless module will meet our needs for the
project.

As the project progresses, this README file will hone in on the details
of the communication software for this project. For now, this file serves
as a test to make sure that I can upload files to the repo.
